#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role was integrating the IGDB video game API to the app. I worked on the home page to display all the games and the game details page. 

+ What was the biggest challenge?
   + The biggest challenge was getting the game details page to work and figuring out the navigation with React Native. 
+ Why was it a challenge?
   + It was a challenge because when clicking on a game that didn't have an image, it would not let me navigate to the game details page. The navigation was also very weird and we had to have some imports like useNavigation to get it to work properly.
   + How was the challenge addressed?
      + I fixed the query to ensure that the games being displayed all had a cover image, name, and description. 
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
   + My favorite part of this project was seeing the app work on my phone when using the ExpoGo app and actively seeing the changes being made live, like seeing the API data show up on the home page.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
   +I would work more on the design of the home page and game details page so that it looks nicer and cleaner. I would also do unit tests first and communicate with my team members more when I was having trouble. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
   + I learned that it is important to ask for help and go to the teacher if needed and to always update your team on what you're doing or what you're stuck on.
