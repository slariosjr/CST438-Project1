#### What was your role / which stories did you work on

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + READING DOCUMENTATION, and learning react native. 
+ Why was it a challenge?
   +  I spent like 30+ hours reading documentation, to ether get a non answer. React native makes me really understand why Developers hate the Facebook ecosystem.
  + How was the challenge addressed?.
     + I read lot of documentation, asked alot of questions to some of my friends in class. I managed to get alot done. 
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
   + I actually liked the database portion of the project, Database design is actually really mentally stimulating. 
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
   + Not use react native, but keep SQLite and maybe use something else for the application, like tauri native. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
   + How to properly use github issues, to mark difficulty and to show progress. I think the next project I do am gonna stay away from design roles for abit since am feeling the burnout.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role was integrating the IGDB video game API to the app. I worked on the home page to display all the games and the game details page. 

+ What was the biggest challenge?
   + The biggest challenge was getting the game details page to work and figuring out the navigation with React Native. 
+ Why was it a challenge?
   + It was a challenge because when clicking on a game that didn't have an image, it would not let me navigate to the game details page. The navigation was also very weird and we had to have some imports like useNavigation to get it to work properly.
   + How was the challenge addressed?
      + I fixed the query to ensure that the games being displayed all had a cover image, name, and description. 
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
   + My favorite part of this project was seeing the app work on my phone when using the ExpoGo app and actively seeing the changes being made live, like seeing the API data show up on the home page.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
   + I would work more on the design of the home page and game details page so that it looks nicer and cleaner. I would also do unit tests first and communicate with my team members more when I was having trouble. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
   + I learned that it is important to ask for help and go to the teacher if needed and to always update your team on what you're doing or what you're stuck on.

   - Kyla: We were able to have a login, home, and settings tab.
   - Silvia:
   - Sergio:
- Think in terms of what did you set out to do and what actually got done?
  - Alex: I wore many hats, dependng on the weather. Am actually really happy for how the database turned out, and doing the last round of polish before its due is satisifing. 
  - Kyla: I was set out to work on the home page and API integration and I was able to get the home page done.
  - Silvia:
  - Sergio:
- What was the largest victory?
   - Alex: When The database was programmed in one day, and the last features was programed in a drunken all nigher. Fundamentally proving the blamer peak is not a myth but the truth. Its going to be a fun story am gonna randomly pull out of nowhere. I remember logging into warframe after pushing my last PR, and it was well earned. 
   - Kyla: I thought the largest victory was when the database was integrated into the project. 
   - Silvia:
   - Sergio:
- Final assessment of the project
